			<div class="version-box">
				<h2>Version P1 (Prototype 1) -- 03.05.2016</h2>
				<p>First prototype of the website! Features simple sound and a counter (non-saved).</p>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div class="version-box">
				<h2>Version P2 (Prototype 2) -- 15.05.2016</h2>
				<p>Second prototype of the website! Features more complex sound (multiplay, ..) and a saved counter via PHP/JS.</p>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div class="version-box">
				<h2>Version P3 (Prototype 3) -- 24.05.2016</h2>
				<p>The third prototype, woo! Features SQL implementation via PHP, with the help of Kagumi (see credits).</p>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div class="version-box">
				<h2>Version 1.0 (!) -- 04.06.2016</h2>
				<p>
					Woohoo, initial release! Features a sidebar with contact info as well as links to partner sites. Also, counter is now
					saved in cache (background), while the counter seen on the page is instantly updated. (Meaning that even if cache gets
					under load, the button will keep up for you personally, and update in the background. This may result in discrepancies
					if you press the button fast and instantly refresh, but don't worry!)
				</p>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div class="version-box">
				<h2>Version 1.1 -- 28.06.2016</h2>
				<p>
					At last, finals are over! This version adds sound randomization for the button, so you'll no longer exclusively hear
					"yamero", but also various others such as her name intro! (Currently 5 different sounds have been implemented. I am
					open to add more if I am provided with a theme-fitting crop of the sound in mp3 format.)
				</p>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div class="version-box">
				<h2>Version 1.2 -- 05.11.2016</h2>
				<p>
					Well, I sure haven't done anything in a long time. This update makes the switch from MySQL to SQLite, introduces a whole
					bunch of new sounds as well as minor improvements to the CSS and HTML. And a little information: I plan on adding more
					sounds once Season 2 goes live, so stay tuned for that!
				</p>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div class="version-box">
				<h2>Version 1.3 - 18.12.2016</h2>
				<p>
					It is finally time -- the website now has live updates for the counter! Never refresh the page just to see if anyone
					besides you has clicked the button ever again, just sit back and watch! This version also adds a soundboard for all
					your megumin needs, whenever and wherever you want, so go wild with your favorites. In addition several minor adjustments
					have been made, which however do not add any extra functionality.
				</p>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div class="version-box">
				<h2>Version 2.0 - 16.04.2017</h2>
				<p>
					A complete rewrite of the website's backend from PHP to Node.js! The website now has a real live-updating counter, no
					more simulated updating after 1,5 seconds. In addition, two template error pages (404 &amp; 500) have been added, ion.sound
					was replaced with howler.js. The counter should now also operate faster, as memcached caching has been removed. The
					counter is from here on out cached directly in the server's memory, meaning no additional time-consuming requests have
					to be made.
				</p>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div class="version-box">
				<h2>Version 2.1 - 01.06.2017</h2>
				<p>
					Statistics, hooray! No longer will the questions "I wonder how many clicks there have been today/this week/this month?"
					go unanswered! Statistics are automatically updated into database and also live-update along with the front page counter.
					Also, "/x.html" links such as "megumin.love/x.html" are now redirected to just "/x", e.g. "megumin.love/x", provided
					the page actually exists. This is because previously that is how the pages were accessed, as early visitors may know.
					Oh, and pretty formatted counters in "x.xxx.xxx" format! Plus some minor changes that do not affect the user.
				</p>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div class="version-box">
				<h2>Version 2.2 - 03.06.2017</h2>
				<p>
					Actually not that many changes here, but wanted to write this for the sake of consistency. This update only changes things
					unrelated to the user, such as using object deconstruction on various modules, moving all code-related files to a source
					folder away from environment files such as travis or eslint. Also, minor non-breaking dependency updates.
				</p>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div class="version-box">
				<h2>Version 2.3 - 24.06.2017</h2>
				<p>
					The soundboard is finally adjusted to work on mobile, hooray! This is thanks to GitHub User Danktuary, as noted in the credits.
					In addition to that, the inner workings of the website have been further optimized. And lastly, you can now get more precise
					statistics from dates before today! So if anyone wants to somehow integrate the website's statistics in an app of their
					own, they now can, using the '/stats' endpoint (https://megumin.love/stats). Check out the website's Wiki on the GitHub
					Repo (or click the link on the statistics page of the website itself) for more information.
				</p>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div class="version-box">
				<h2>Version 2.4 - 31.07.2017</h2>
				<p>
					Another improvement of the soundboard -- this time one more focused on the development side, rather than the user's side.
					All of the soundboard's content is now dynamically created based on the registered sounds, without having to manually create
					all of the required HTML elements such as the titles, the button wrapper or the buttons themselves. Adding new categories
					(seasons) is also done automatically, meaning developers only have to change a single file instead of multiple ones.
					See the updated README / the GitHub release for details on new usage.
				</p>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div class="version-box">
				<h2>Version 3.0 - 21.09.2017</h2>
				<p>
					Major version, breaking changes, woop. This release adds a ranking for the soundboard! Ever wondered which button on the soundboard
					is the most popular? Your question shall be answered! (As soon as some time after the implementation of this passes...)
					In addition, some various fixes such as typos or small design errors have been applied. The firstRun setting has been removed and
					the server now always makes sure the database both exists and is fit for usage with the website! Yay for less user configuration!
					Lastly, various behind-the-scenes changes have been made to make the code less repetitive and more reusable (also colorful logs!).
				</p>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div class="version-box">
				<h2>Version 4.0 - 06.12.2017</h2>
				<p>
					Another major version. A lot of background changes in this one, but there's a few user features too. Background changes include
					reducing the information that is sent on each counter update (reducing bandwidth usage for the user and my server), the "season"
					setting being renamed to "source" so that you can add sounds from other sources easier than you could before, replacing the mp3
					default sounds with ogg versions and falling back to mp3 format (aac completely removed) as well as a safeguard for non-existing
					sound events being emitted from the soundboard -- the biggest background change however would the switch from socket.io to uws.
					There's a lot more, you can check the GitHub release for that. Changes visible to the user include higher-quality images
					(backgrounds, sidebar), with the sidebar even transitioning to a vector graphic for that beautiful scaling. Also, some design
					adjustments have been made so the website looks more unified and better on most modern browsers. The biggest feature coming in
					this release however are the randomized backgrounds! Currently the website randomizes which background will be shown to the user
					out of six in total, but there is also an option to stop the randomization and instead use one of the backgrounds of your choice.
					And lastly, the "version" page you are on as you are reading this has been renamed to "versions", which makes more sense. Again,
					more changes are listed on the <a href="https://github.com/robflop/megumin.love/releases/tag/v4.0.0">GitHub releases page</a>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div class="version-box">
				<h2>Version 5.0 - 28.01.2018</h2>
				<p>
					Third time's the charm, major update. The main backend feature which the user doesn't see is that how the website saves data has
					been restructured, so information about sounds isn't saved in JSON anymore but in the database. The amount of soundboard clicks
					(i.e. rankings) are	now stored alongside the sound's filename, displayname and source, which should be more efficient. This change
					requires you to run a database migration script which I have provided in the repository. Use it before trying to boot the website.
					The major frontend feature, which the user (or in this case, the admin) does see is the new admin panel. Using this panel you
					can do three things: Upload new sounds, rename existing ones or delete sounds. Each action will also be live-updated onto the
					soundboard, the rankings and the main page -- so currently visiting users will be served new sounds as soon as they are uploaded,
					the soundboard will be rebuilt to adjust itself for potential new sections or renamed/deleted sounds and the rankings list will
					adjust itself to account for the change done via the admin panel. Absolutely no code is required to use the panel, only text and
					file input in a form which you submit and the server then processes. Logging into the admin panel requires a password you can
					configure in the website's configuration file (see the instructions provided in the GitHub Repository). Besides this, various
					small adjustments have been made that do not have a big impact on user or admin.
